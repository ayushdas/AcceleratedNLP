I now delight
In spite
Of the might
And 9the right
Of cl9assic tradition,
In wr9it9ing
And r9eciting
St9raig9ht ahead,
Without le9t or omission,
Just any little rhyme
In a9ny little t9ime
That r9u9ns in my head;
Because, I9ve said,
My rh9ymes no9 longer 9shall stand arrayed
Like Prussian soldiers on 9parade
That march,
Stiff9 as starch,
Fo99ot to foot,
Boot to boot,
Blade to blad9e,
Bu9tton to button,
Cheeks and chops and c9hins like mutton.
No! N9o!
My rhymes must go
Turn 'ee, twist 'ee,
Twin9kling, frosty,
Will-o'-the-wisp-like, misty;
